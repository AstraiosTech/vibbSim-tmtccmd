# For Nathaniel's Machine (Windows 11)
# 1. Install X Server app such as Xming or VcXsrv (I used VcXsrv)
# 2. MAKE SURE TO USE BASH TERMINAL
# 3. use command "echo $DISPLAY"
# 3a. if it's empty, use command "export host.docker.internal:0"
# 3b. use command "echo $DISPLAY" to make sure that the env DISPLAY variable is "host.docker.internal:0"
# 4. run the "docker run ... " command shown above
# 4a. if you're already at the base directory, then "src=." also works
